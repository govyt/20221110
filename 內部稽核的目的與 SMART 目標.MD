What is a SMART Goal?
設定戰略和可實現的目標是發展業務的重要組成部分，因為它們為您提供了一個可以努力實現的目標。
目標是一種激勵手段，可以幫助你專注於特定的任務，而不是一個模糊的改進概念。
由於它們非常重要，因此花時間確保您設定的目標是明智的也是謹慎的。
Setting strategic and attainable goals is a vital part of growing your business as they provide you with a target to work towards. 
Goals function as a means of motivation and help you focus on a specific task rather than a vague concept of betterment. 
Since they’re so important, it’s also prudent to spend time to ensure the goals you set are SMART.

Here SMART is an acronym that stands for:

Specific: The goal needs to be clear and precise. 
具體：目標需要明確和精確。
Specific goals have a higher likelihood of being accomplished than generic ones. 
To check if your goal is specific enough, see if it answers a few questions like “What needs to be done?” “Who will work on the documentation process?” and “What apparatus will the work involve?” 
These will provide you with a sense of direction regarding your goal and take the guesswork out of the process for better efficiency in your operations.

Measurable: You need to create a scale that helps measure your progress towards your goal.
可衡量的：您需要創建一個量表來幫助衡量您在實現目標方面取得的進展。
Having measurable goals provides an opportunity for positive feedback on the progress you have made and a source of motivation to achieve your objectives. 
Additionally, having well-defined goals and a means to measure them accordingly helps you identify possible setbacks and trends so you can work on these problems proactively for the future. 
Ask yourself questions like: 
“How will I know if my goal has been achieved?” 
“In the meantime, what are some progress indicators to look out for?”


Achievable: Needs to be within the realm of possibility to achieve. 
可實現的：需要在可能實現的範圍內。
If a goal is too difficult it will quickly demotivate anyone set out to accomplish it; 
similarly, if a goal is too easy it’s prone to fall into a procrastination pile for the same reasons. 
Because of this, a smart goal must be both challenging yet achievable.

Realistic: Goals should be realistic within the set time frame.
可實現的：目標應該在設定的時間範圍內是可實現的。
You need to give yourself enough resources to ensure the goal is achievable. 
Ask yourself if you’re able to commit to the goal and if it’s one that has previously been accomplished within similar parameters.

Timely: Specify a timeline that includes a set starting and ending date to complete your project. 
及時：指定一個時間表，其中包括完成項目的設定開始和結束日期。
You need to remember to allow yourself ample room for error or delay while also setting reasonable time frames to create a sense of urgency so you’re more likely to start on it.
